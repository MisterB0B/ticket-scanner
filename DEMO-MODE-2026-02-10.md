# Ticket Scanner Demo Mode - 2026-02-10

## What Changed

**GPS detection disabled for Ellen demo.** App now defaults to "Demo Location" without asking for location permissions or waiting for GPS.

## Before (GPS Detection)
- App tried to detect venue via GPS geofence
- Showed "Location unavailable" error if GPS failed
- Required manual venue selection or manager PIN override

## After (Demo Mode)
- ✅ **Immediately shows "Demo Location"** on launch
- ✅ No GPS prompt, no waiting
- ✅ No location errors
- ✅ Straight to login screen

## Changes Made

### 1. detectVenue() Function
```javascript
// OLD: Tried GPS, showed errors
navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(...)

// NEW: Skip GPS entirely
currentVenue = 'demo';
venueDetected = true;
document.getElementById('detectedVenueName').textContent = 'Demo Location';
```

### 2. Added 'demo' Venue
```javascript
VENUE_GEOFENCES = {
  demo: { name: 'Demo Location', lat: 0, lng: 0, radius: 99999999 },
  // ... other venues
}
```

## User Experience

**Launch app →** See "Demo Location" immediately → Select staff name → Enter PIN 1260 → Start scanning

**No more:**
- ❌ "Location unavailable" error
- ❌ "Retry" button
- ❌ GPS permission prompt
- ❌ Waiting for geofence detection

## Re-enabling GPS Later

To restore GPS detection when ready:
1. Revert the `detectVenue()` function to original code
2. Remove the hardcoded `currentVenue = 'demo'` line
3. Test geofences at actual venues
