# Ticket Scanner Add-Ons Update - 2026-02-10

## What Changed

Updated add-ons to **exactly match the Ticketing Prototype** — these are items customers PRE-PURCHASED online and pick up at the tent.

## Complete Add-On List (from Ticketing Prototype)

### Pre-Purchased Add-Ons (Popular)
1. **Blitzen Bundle** - $29.99 🎁
   - Popcorn + 2 Lemonades + 2 Wands + 2 Glasses
2. **Bucket of Popcorn** - $9.99 🍿
3. **The Light Wand** - $7.99 🪄
4. **DJ Polar Ice Plush** - $24.99 🐻❄️

### Food & Drinks
- Bucket of Popcorn - $9.99

- Cotton Candy - $4.99

### Merchandise
- The Light Wand - $7.99
- 2-Pack Magic Glasses - $5.99
- DJ Polar Ice Plush - $24.99
- Adventures of DJ Polar Ice (Book) - $14.99

### Bundles
- Blitzen Bundle - $29.99 (Popcorn + 2 Lemonades + 2 Wands + 2 Glasses)

## What Was Removed
- ❌ **Dasher Pass** - Removed per Bob's instruction ("customers already at tent, tent is after regular queue and dasher pass")
- ❌ All Command Center menu items (those are sold separately, not pre-purchased add-ons)

## How It Works
1. Customer buys ticket online + selects add-ons
2. At the show, they drive through (Dasher Pass customers skip line)
3. **At the tent**, staff scan ticket and see pre-purchased add-ons
4. Staff fulfill the add-ons (hand out popcorn, wands, plush, etc.)

## Key Difference
- **Ticketing Prototype** = What customers can PRE-PURCHASE online
- **Ticket Scanner** = Show what was PRE-PURCHASED (for tent fulfillment)
- **Command Center** = What staff can SELL at tent (walk-up purchases)
